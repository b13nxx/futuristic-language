This project will be a **constructed** international **foreign** language that can be easily understood and spoken by everyone.

# Introduction

Hello folks. As of today, I am starting a very special project.

I will take steps to create an **International Foreign Language**. Here I used the term `Foreign` instead of the term `Auxiliary` that everyone is familiar with. Because the point that I want to emphasize in the first place is that this language **will not be** a language that will **try to replace the natural languages** ​​in the world, namely your mother tongues (even though it's exactly same meaning with the term `Auxiliary` but it's not as strong as the term `Foreign`). It will be **a bridge language** you can use when you want to talk to people other than your mother tongue. In order to do that, I used the stronger term `Foreign`.

First, I will do the necessary research and then apply them to the new language itself. The reason why this project will be special is that it will be developed in a digital environment in accordance with today's dynamics. I don't know how many of you are Software Engineers, but I'm talking about a taste like a software library. You know, you develop the project as open source, you follow the semantic versioning so that the people who follow the project know what's going on, etc.

# Name of the Language

I haven't decided what to name it yet. However, I have a few possibilities in mind. I actually want it to be named when the first version of the language is released. It's gonna be interesting :)
