# Introduction

Hello folks. As of today, I am starting a very special project.

I will take steps to create an **International Foreign Language**. Here I used the term `Foreign` instead of the term `Auxiliary` that everyone is familiar with. Because the point that I want to emphasize in the first place is that this language **will not be** a language that will **try to replace the natural languages** ​​in the world, namely your mother tongues (even though it's exactly same meaning with the term `Auxiliary` but it's not as strong as the term `Foreign`). It will be **a bridge language** you can use when you want to talk to people other than your mother tongue. In order to do that, I used the stronger term `Foreign`.

First, I will do the necessary research and then apply them to the new language itself. The reason why this project will be special is that it will be developed in a digital environment in accordance with today's dynamics. I don't know how many of you are Software Engineers, but I'm talking about a taste like a software library. You know, you develop the project as open source, you follow the semantic versioning so that the people who follow the project know what's going on, etc.

# Name of the Language

I haven't decided what to name it yet. However, I have a few possibilities in mind. I actually want it to be named when the first stable version of the language is released. It's gonna be interesting :)

# Core Values

We can say that in order to have a constructed international foreign language that to be universal, to be able to appeal to everyone, to be learned easily and to be adopted, it must have accepted the following:

### Neutral

It should not have a connection with any political or ethnic group. The language itself should not have a certain culture and should not give an advantage to those who know that culture. It should not distinguish between masculine or feminine too.

### Stable

The rules of the language should be chosen carefully and should be applied in the same way to all the words, idioms and expressions in it.

### Simple

There should be no grammatical rules that can create complexity.

### Flexible

Grammar rules should be flexible enough so that every person with another mother tongue should be able to maintain the traditions of their own language to a certain extent.

### Balanced

Instead of trying to have a mix of the most spoken languages in the world, it should be equally distant and difficult to everyone who has another mother tongue.

## Is there an order of importance for the core values we mentioned?

Of course. One day in the future, when there is a conflict about the development of the language, how will we solve it otherwise?

The core values that we mentioned above are the aspects that language should give the most importance. All of them are the most important values. That's why we call them **CORE VALUES**. Let's not take this the wrong way.

But they are also listed in order of importance. In other words, if there is a conflict situation with more than one core value on a subject that is intended to be put into effect one day, neutrality should be more important than all other core values. Likewise, stability should be more important than any other core values except neutrality, and so on.

## Most Important Aspect: Evolvable Language

Not representing this as a core value. However, it is an asset that everyone should have in mind. **Core values cannot be changed** under any circumstances, but everything else **can be changed, developed, or dropped, provided the core values are adhered to**. Because even if a language is artificially constructed, it needs to live and evolve like a living organism. This will ensure the **continuity of the language**.
